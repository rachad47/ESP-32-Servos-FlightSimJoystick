# ESP-32-Servos-FlightSimJoystick
Processing + Arduino ide (for ESP-32) code to use servo motors with Joystick using GCP library


We found a library that works well with the Joystick I have (Logitech) and Xbox handcontroller GCP library we also found a tutorial that explains how to use it with arduino.:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUM8_4mWxng&t=816s&ab_channel=MakeUseOf

As we are using ESP-32 some libraries such as Servo.h, Fermata doesn't work I had to do some reseahch I wasn't able to find a specefic tutorial A->Z but here is the code im using and its wokring great with ESP, If you have an ESP still watch the Arduino tutorial above as it goes trough some important setup things then check the code for both arduinoIDE and Processing to make it work with ESP
